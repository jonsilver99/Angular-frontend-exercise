# HeroloCinema

Angular 5 exercise. 
- In this exercise - data from external api is loaded & rendered into a responsive gallery. The gallery is designed with flexbox and features a 'lazy load' functionality, i.e whenever a user scrolls to the bottom of the gallery more data is loaded & rendered.
- The app also features 'create', 'update' and 'delete' functionalities.
- All frontend dynamics are updated using redux pattern, preserving immutability.
